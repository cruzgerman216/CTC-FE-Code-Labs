# Exam Study Exercises

**Read before starting**
In Code-Labs, create a new folder called class-10. You will be working in the class-10 folder for today.

## Exercise 1:

- Create a folder inside of class-10 called exercise-1
- Inside exercise-1, create a file called [index.html](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

Display 4 [images](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp) of animals.

## Exercise 2:

- Create a folder inside of class-10 called exercise-2
- Inside exercise-1, create a file called index.html

Create a h1 with content of " 'Your name' Blog'.

For example,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>

Include an image with height 300px and width 200px

## Exercise 3:

In the class-10 folder, create a folder called exercise-3.
Create a div with the class name center.

In the div, create a h1 with content 'Mary's Food Restaurant'.
For example,

```html
<div class="center">
  <h1>Marry's Food Restaurant</h1>
</div>
```

After the h1, create an h2 element with content 'Smoothies and Chicken Noodles'.

After the h2, create an [unordered list](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists_unordered.asp).
Each list item should have a several menu items.

Last but not least, [center the div](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/)

## Exercise 4:

In the class-10 folder, create a folder called exercise-4.
Create a file called index.html.
Create a index.js file.

Link index.js to index.html like so with the script element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
    <!-- Here -->
    <script src="./index.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

Use `console.log()` to log a number to the console. For example,

```js
console.log(10);
```

## Exercise 5:

In the class-10 folder, create a folder called exercise-5.
Create the necessary files to do the following:

In JavaScript, log to the console the following [data types](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp)

- number
- string
- boolean
- object
- array

## Exercise 6:

In the class-10 folder, create a folder called exercise-6.
Let's create some variables in JavaScript.

Here's an example,

Declare a let variable called firstName

```js
let firstName;
```

Initialize firstName to a string that represents a name.

```js
let firstName;
firstName = "John";
```

Log to the console fistName.

```js
let firstName;
firstName = "John";
console.log(firstName);
```

- Declare a variable called lastName
- Initialize lastName to your last name.
- log to the console lastName.

- Declare a variable called favoriteNumber;
- Initialize favoriteNumber to your favorite number. Make sure it's data type is a number.
- Log to the console favoriteNumber.

- Declare a variable called person
- Initialize person to an object with the following properties
  - firstName
  - lastName
  - age

log to the console person.

Here's an example of a variable called user set to the following properties

- email
- username

```js
let user = {
  email: "John123@gmail.com",
  username: "john123",
};
```

## Exercise 7

In the class-10 folder, create a folder called exercise-7.

Declare a variable called a and set it equal to 5.
Declare a variable called b and set it equal to 10.

Use a and b to demonstrate javaScript operators.

Here is the plus operator demonstration.

```js 
console.log("a + b is ", a + b) // a + b is 15
```

Log the evaluation of a and b using the following [operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp)

  - Multiplication 
  - subtraction 
  - division 
  - Modulus
  - Exponentiation
  - Division
  - Increment 
  - decrement

## Exercise 8 
In the class-10 folder, create a folder called exercise-8.

Declare a variable called a and set it equal to 5.
Declare a variable called b and set it equal to 5.

Use a and b to demonstrate javaScript operators.

Here is the equal to sign demonstration.

```js 
console.log("a == b is ", a == b) // a == b is true
```

Log the evaluation of a and b using the following [JavaScript Comparison Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp)

  - equal value and equal type
  - not equal value or not equal type
  - greater than sign 
  - less than
  - greater than or equal to
  - less than or equal to


## Exercise 9 
In the class-10 folder, create a folder called exercise-9.

Declare a variable called firstName and set it equal to "John".

Use [Conditional Statements](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp) to do the following:

If firstName is equal to John, log to the console "Found John!" otherwise log to the console "Have you found John?".

## Exercise 10 
In the class-10 folder, create a folder called exercise-10.

Use a [loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration) to print numbers 0 - 50.
