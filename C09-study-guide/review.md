# Study Guide

## Concepts

- **JavaScript:** _JavaScript_ is one of the core programming languages of the Web. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to their page. You can use JavaScript to build interactive websites, mobile apps, backend APIs, desktop applications, and even machine learning projects!

- **DevTools:** _DevTools_ are the tools built directly into the browser, providing developers the ability to diagnose problems quickly, check network performance, write simple scripts, inspect the web page, and more.

- **Data Types:** _Data types_ are a classification that specifies which _type_ of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational, or logical operations can be applied to it (without causing an error).

- **Operators:** _Operators_ are objects capable of manipulating or evaluating an expression. Standard operators include, but are not limited to:

  - \+
  - \-
  - \
  - \*
  - \>
  - <
  - ===
  - !==

- **Conditional Statement:** _Conditional Statements_ are a programming expression or command that instructs a computer to run code if a specified statement is truthy or not.

- **Function:** A _function_ is a way to create an on-demand, reusable and executable code block.

- **Object:** Almost everything in JavaScript is an _object_. _Objects_ in a nutshell, are a set of self-contained key-value pairs.

- **DOM:** The _DOM_ or _Document Object Model_ is a built-in HTML API that defines teh document's logical structure in object format for easily creating or manipulating elements

- **Event Listener:** An _event listener_ is an interface for an object that can dispatch event methods on an "EventTarget" object

- **Local Storage:** _Local Storage_ is a type of web storage located in the browser that persists data even after page reload

- **API:** An _API (Application Programming Interface)_ is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other

- **ECMAScript:** _ECMAScript_ is a standard the company _ECMA_ created of which JavaScript is built from and continues to implement and improve upon. ECMA has been shortened to ES as in ES6 or ES7.

- **Variable:** A _variable_ is a container that holds a value or piece of reusable data

- **Scope:** _Scope_ in programming refers to the area or space where a specific element, data, variable, or value is useable. The two types of scope are _Local_ and _Global_.

- **Hoisting:** _Hoisting_ means the movement of a variable or function to the top of its scope during its execution

- **Closures:** A _Closure_ is a reference to the local scope when code has been executed out of the surrounding state. A closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. Closures are handy in cases where you want to use data encapsulation, create higher-order functions or built-in JavaScript methods like `.map()` or `.filter()`.

- **this:** The _this_ keyword in JavaScript is notorious for being difficult to explain. It ("this") refers to different things depending on its execution context.

- **Design Pattern:** A _design pattern_ is a blueprint and a set of best practices on how to solve a problem and structure your application in a software engineering project.

The three types of design patterns are **creation patterns** (ways to create objects), **structural patterns** (ways to manage relationships between objects), and **behavioral patterns** (interactions between objects).

- **Asynchronous Code:** _Asynchronous code_ is a programming model where operations occur in a non-sequential fashion.

- **Memoization:** _Memoization_ is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs are given.

- **Spread Operator:** The _spread operator_ is a way to expand iterates (arrays, objects, and strings) into a single argument _spread_ across one by one.

- **Rest Operator:** The _rest operator_ is a way to collect all remaining elements in an array of arguments on a function call.
