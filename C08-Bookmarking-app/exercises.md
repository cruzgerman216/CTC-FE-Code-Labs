# JavaScript - Building Real Things 

**Read before starting**
In your `Code-Labs` folder, create a new folder called `class-8-bookmarking-app`. You will be working in the class-8-bookmarking-app folder for today.

## Exercise #0: Before getting started

In `class-8-bookmarking-app`, create a folder called `exercise-0-terms`.

- Create a file called foundations.txt
- Answer the following questions in your own words:

1. What is Local Storage?
2. What an API?

## Exercise #1: Warm Up

In `class-8-bookmarking-app`, create a folder called `exercise-1`.
- Declare a `let` variable called user and set that to an object with properties name and age. 
- Declare a `let` variable called users. Set users to an array of objects with properties name and age.

## Exercise #2: Sum of two numbers

In `class-8-bookmarking-app`, create a folder called `exercise-2`.

- Create a button that will change the background to yellow.

## Exercise #3: 

In `class-8-bookmarking-app`, create a folder called `exercise-3`.

Give the the following function.

```js
    // Function definition
    function add(a,b){

    }

    // Function cll
    add(1, 1) // 2
    add(4, 3) // 7
```

The function `add` should print the addition of both arguments.


## Exercise #4: 

In `class-8-bookmarking-app`, create a folder called `exercise-4`.

Give the the following function.

```js
    // Function definition
    function add(a,b){

    }

    // Function cll
    add(1, 1) // 2
    add(4, 3) // 7
```

The function `add` should print the addition of both arguments.

## Exercise #5: 

In `class-8-bookmarking-app`, create a folder called `exercise-5`.

Given the array:

```js 
  let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
```

Use a loop to iterate through the array and print each number.

## Exercise #6: 
In `class-8-bookmarking-app`, create a folder called `exercise-6`.

Give the link `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random`. 

Use `fetch` to send a request using this url. When you receive a response, 

which should look similar to something like so

```js
{
  message: "https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/kuvasz/n02104029_3526.jpg",
  status: "success"
}
```

Create an img element and attached the src to it. Append the img element to the webpage. 

Every time you reload the page, you should get a new image.

## Exercise 7: 

In `class-8-bookmarking-app`, create a folder called `exercise-7`.

Iterate through this list of users 

```js
user = [
  {
    name: 'John',
    age: 21
  },
  {
    name: 'Amy', 
    age: 42
  }
]
```

and print each detail onto the webpage(not console). This requires you to create elements and append them to the webpage. 

- Create a form with input fields for name and age along with a submit button. When you fill out this form, you will then append that information to the webpage.
