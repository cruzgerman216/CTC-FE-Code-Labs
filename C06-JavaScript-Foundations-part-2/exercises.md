# JavaScript Foundations - Part 2

**Read before starting**
In your `Code-Labs` folder, create a new folder called `class-6-JavaScript-Foundations-part-2`. You will be working in the class-6-JavaScript-Foundations-part-2 folder for today.

## Exercise #0: Before getting started

In `class-6-JavaScript-Foundations-part-2`, create a folder called `exercise-0-terms`.

## Exercise 5: 

In `class-6-JavaScript-Foundations-part-2`, create a folder called `exercise-5`.

**Aim**: Create an application that, on button click, runs a function that prints out a users name, age, and occupation

- [ ] Create the HTML with a button
- [ ] Create a function that takes in a _user_ object
- [ ] Print each item in the user object out in a string to the console


## Exercise 6: 

In `class-6-JavaScript-Foundations-part-2`, create a folder called `exercise-6`.

**Aim**: Create an application that, on button click, runs a function that prints out a users name, age, and occupation

- [ ] Create the HTML with a button
- [ ] Create a function that takes in a _user_ object
- [ ] Print each item in the user object out in a string to the console


## Exercise 7: 

In `class-6-JavaScript-Foundations-part-2`, create a folder called `exercise-7`.

**Aim**: Create a function that takes an object and returns the keys and values as separate arrays. Return the keys sorted alphabetically and their corresponding values in the same order.

_Examples_

```js
keysAndValues({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 })
   ➞    [["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3]]

keysAndValues({ a: "Apple", b: "Microsoft", c: "Google" })
   ➞    [["a", "b", "c"], ["Apple", "Microsoft", "Google"]]

keysAndValues({ key1: true, key2: false, key3: undefined })
   ➞    [["key1", "key2", "key3"], [true, false, undefined]]
```
